## Overview

As of September 2014, Clojure has over a dozen books published (or available for
preview) about it, plus one about ClojureScript. This guide lists some of them
in reverse chronological order and intended to provide a very brief
overview of each. It is by no means comprehensive and may be quite
opinionated. The goal is to identify books that are more useful to
newcomers than others and recommend books that cover recent releases
of Clojure (1.3+).



## Books About Clojure

Note: books are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Clojure Programming Cookbook

By Makoto Hashimoto, Nicolas Modrzyk

#### Notes

Handle every problem you come across in the world of Clojure programming with this expert collection of recipes

This book is divided into three high impact sections. The first section gives you an introduction to live programming and best practices. We show you how to interact with your connections by manipulating, transforming, and merging collections. You’ll learn how to work with macros, protocols, multi-methods, and transducers. We’ll also teach you how to work with languages such as Java, and Scala.
The next section deals with intermediate-level content and enhances your Clojure skills, here we’ll teach you concurrency programming with Clojure for high performance. We will provide you with advanced best practices, tips on Clojure programming, and show you how to work with Clojure while developing applications.
In the final section you will learn how to test, deploy and analyze websocket behavior when your app is deployed in the cloud. Finally, we will take you through DevOps. Developing with Clojure has never been easier with these recipes by your side!

### Mastering Clojure

By Akhil Wali

#### Notes

Understand the philosophy of the Clojure language and dive into its inner workings to unlock its advanced features, methodologies, and constructs

Mastering Clojure gives you an insight into the nitty-gritty details and more advanced features of the Clojure programming language to create more scalable, maintainable, and elegant applications. You’ll start off by learning the details of sequences, concurrency primitives, and macros. Packed with a lot of examples, you’ll get a walkthrough on orchestrating concurrency and parallelism, which will help you understand Clojure reducers, and we’ll walk through composing transducers so you know about functional composition and process transformation inside out. We also explain how reducers and transducers can be used to handle data in a more performant manner.

## Books About ClojureScript

### Learning ClojureScript

By W. David Jarvis, Rafik Naccache, Allen Rohner

#### Notes

Master the art of agile single page web application development with ClojureScript

You will first learn how to construct an interactive development experience for ClojureScript.. You will be guided through ClojureScript language concepts, looking at the basics first, then being introduced to advanced concepts such as functional programming or macro writing. After that, we elaborate on the subject of single page web applications, showcasing how to build a simple one, then covering different possible enhancements. We move on to study more advanced ClojureScript concepts, where you will be shown how to address some complex algorithmic cases. Finally, you'll learn about optional type-checking for your programs, how you can write portable code, test it, and put the advanced compilation mode of the Google Closure Compiler to good use.
